            I like this band because the emotional impact that their songs carry, on top of their overall <b>listenability</b>. They are a good comfort band and just overall make good <b>music</b> that is easily listenable.

    <h1>S Number Section</h1>
    <p>
    This Python snippet checks whether a list contains duplicate values by comparing
    the length of the list to the length of a set created from the list. Since sets
    only store unique values, a difference in length means duplicates exist.
    </p>

    <pre>
        def check_for_duplicates(input):
            return len(input) != len(set(input))
    </pre>
